# Sudoku Solver Android Application

This application represents a Sudoku Solver developed using a bruteforce algorithm and multithreading as a part of the "Parallel Computing Systems" course project at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in East Sarajevo. In addition to the application, a research paper in the Serbian language is attached, containing a comparative analysis of results obtained using a single thread and an optimal number of threads. It also includes an analysis of the average time required to solve Sudoku puzzles based on the number of threads.

## Application Functionalities
